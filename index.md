Hello!!

I am Palanivel Kodeswaran. I am a Senior Research Scientist working at
IBM Research. My research interests are broadly in the areas of
systems, networking and applied security. My current research is
focussed around guaranteeing performance for Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) on Kubernetes, particularly in the emerging
context of 5G and low latency edge applications such as VR/AR. 

More recently, I worked on designing and building enterprise
blockchain applications. I was involved in the design of decentralized
marketplaces as well as incubating and delivering several blockchain
based applications that laid the foundation for IBM Products in
[Digital Trade and Supply chain](https://www.tradelens.com/). 


In the past, I have worked on mobile security and healthcare IoT.

I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science from the [University of
Maryland,Baltimore County](http://www.csee.umbc.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr Anupam Joshi](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~joshi/).
